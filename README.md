A simple php library that allows you to create your own bot.

## What will be new in v2? 
 - Many bug fixes (including reconnect bug encountered by some people)
 - We're now async! This means, more operations can be handled by the same time without actually blocking your code
 - Async Tasks, and a better Task handler with precise repetition rates (tick every 50ms)
 - Promise system to execute code once an async workload was done
 - Slash command support
 - console commands can now also be done by a simple API
 - docs rewrite
